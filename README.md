# 📊 Hospital Data Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing hospital data to gain insights into patient distribution, department performance, treatment costs, and admission trends. An interactive dashboard was created using Power BI to support data-driven decision-making in a healthcare environment.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze patient data across different hospital departments  
- Understand patient demographics such as gender distribution  
- Identify admission trends over time  
- Compare treatment costs across departments  
- Build an interactive and user-friendly Power BI dashboard  

---

## 🗂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains hospital-related information where each record represents a single patient.

### Key Columns
- Patient_ID – Unique identifier for patients  
- Doctor_ID – Unique identifier for doctors  
- Department – Hospital department name  
- Gender – Gender of the patient  
- Admission_Date – Date of patient admission  
- Treatment_Cost – Cost of treatment  
- Length_of_Stay – Number of days stayed in hospital  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Power BI Desktop  
- Power Query  
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)  
- Microsoft Excel  

---

## 🔄 Data Cleaning & Preparation
The following steps were performed using Power Query:
- Removed duplicate records  
- Handled missing values  
- Standardized categorical fields (Gender and Department)  
- Converted columns to appropriate data types

## 📐 DAX Measures Created
- **Total Patients** – Total number of patient records  
- **Total Doctors** – Distinct count of doctors  
- **Average Treatment Cost** – Average cost per patient  
- **Average Length of Stay** – Average duration of hospital stay  

---

## 📊 Dashboard Visualizations
- KPI Cards for key metrics  
- Bar Chart – Patients by Department  
- Donut Chart – Gender Distribution  
- Line Chart – Admissions Over Time  
- Column Chart – Treatment Cost by Department  
- Slicers for Department, Gender, and Admission Date  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Certain departments handle a higher number of patients  
- Gender distribution provides demographic insights  
- Admission trends help identify peak periods  
- Treatment costs vary significantly across departments
